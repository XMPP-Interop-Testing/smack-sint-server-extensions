/**
 * Integration tests that verify that behavior defined in section 8.5.2.1.3 "Local User / localpart@domainpart / Available or Connected Resources / IQ" of section 8 "Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas" of RFC6121.
 *
 * The specification mentions both 'Available' and 'Connected' resources in its titles, but it does not seem to have any specifications for Connected Resources, apart from a more global description in RFC 6120 (section 10.5).
 * There, the conditions described are mostly based on 'SHOULD' keywords. As such, this implementation tests mostly scenarios with 'Available' resources, and not 'Connected' ones. 
 * See https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/thread/L2JTVXQVXW4EQGFM56H5HHJBU6HVPVXK/

     * with a priority value taken from the second argument to this method.
     *
     * The steps taken to set up the test fixture and execute the test, in detail:
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     *     First, additional resources for conTwo are created, so that this user has as many resources online as the
     *     number of priorities provided to this method.
     * <li>
     *     For all of these resources, a presence update is sent, to set a particular prio value (from the provided
     *     method argument)
     * <li>
     *     Then, the stanza that's the subject of the test is sent to the _bare_ JID of the conTwo user (from the
     *     conOne user).
     * <li>
     *     Finally, a message stanza is sent to the _full_ JID of each of the resources to signal the end of the test.
     *     This is done to avoid having to depend on timeouts in scenarios where it is expected that _no_ stanza arrives.
     *     After receiving the message stanza sent to the full JID, the original stanza is expected to have been processed
     *     (as it was sent later and stanzas are processed in order).
     * </ol>
     *
     * After a test fixture has been created, and the stanza that is the subject of this test has been sent (and should
     * have been processed by the server), the assertions provided as the third argument to this method will be executed.
     *
     * Finally, the test fixture is torn down. This involves resetting state, releasing all event listeners, and
     * shutting down any conTwo connections that were created as part of the test fixture setup.
     *
     * @param resourcePriorities The presence priority values of each of the resources of conTwo that will be online during the test.
